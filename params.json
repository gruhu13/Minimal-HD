Sometimes Apple changes the names of images they use within iOS and doing so breaks Minimal HD. If you find a problem like this or anything else let us know what has changed there. If you cannot find an existing issue, please open one. It's really easy!\r\n","google":"UA-19816756-5","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
