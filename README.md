\b \cf0 Guidelines
\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa300

\fs28 \cf3 In order to create a Minimal HD icon you will need Photoshop as well as the 
\b \cf3 template \cf4 here\cf3 .
\b0 \cf3 \
Please Watch the following Guidelines: \
1. Always make clear and as minimalistic as possible icons\
2. Please Always use the colours given and make your "picture" white!\
3. Do not (or only if it 
\i \cf3 really is necessary
\i0 \cf3 ) make your white "picture" of the icon bigger than the blue lines!\

\b\fs56 \cf0 Submitting a Bug
\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa300

\fs28 \cf3 Sometimes app makers change the icon names that they use and doing so breaks Minimal HD. Sometimes Apple changes the names of images they use within iOS and doing so breaks Minimal HD. If you find a problem like this or anything else \cf9 \ul \ulc9 let us know \cf3 \ulnone what has changed there. If you cannot find an existing issue, 
\i \cf3 please open one
\i0 \cf3 . It's really easy!\
